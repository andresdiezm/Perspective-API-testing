The dataset includes a unique comment id, the text of the comment, and a series of binary labels applied by human raters: \"toxic,\" \"severe_toxic,\" \"obscene,\" \"threat,\" \"insult,\" and \"identity_hate.\" I have appended the \"score\" column, which represents the toxicity score assigned to the comment text by the live version of the Perspective API.

Show me one policy that says you cannot blank active block messages on your talk page, hmmm?  While WP:DRC is merely a guideline, there is a distinct lack of Wikipedia policy limiting what kind of content users can remove from their Talk page.  I happen to think there should be policy limiting what a person is allowed to remove from their own talk page (e.g. warnings <24 hours old and active block notices) but as it currently stands there is no such policy, at least not that I can find.

I disagree with the rules, but I realize they have been formed by community consensus and so I will abide by them as long as they are in place.  And by my interpretation of the current rules, Karaku's blanking of the Talk page should never have been reverted.  \n",

Karaku very clearly indicated a desire to do just that (is there really that much difference between putting a banner saying \"\"Retired\"\" at the top of your Talk page vs. blanking the thing with the edit summary \"\"fuck it\"\"?).\n",

Although he only did it as he knew reporting me to SPI would have probably brought him to much attention - at that stage he was still trying to keep the whole thing quiet, as it obviously benefited him. Not that he need have worried - every admin that ever responded to him, either at SPI or AIV, took the exact same view of my socking as as you espouse here (although obviously some were motivated by more than just incompetence). As such, it's likely your report to AIV is only going to ensure their names don't get picked up and the systems/attitudes/culture that cause this obviously counter-productive reaction don't get fixed - meaning that Werieth might as well try his arm at another return later. It speaks volumes that you'd think reverting me was remotely a good thing, even though in that very same ANI there's an arb explaining how he could have probably picked up on this whole thing much earlier if it wasn't for just that sort of mindless cycle of reversion and blocking of obvious socks, on the basis all socking is ebil.

(Ebyabe made comments which appear to be reasonable at first glance, but are actually unreasonable because one is fraudulent and the other was untrue regarding a place where she could see that it was untrue.)  Well a sort-of reasonable comment anyway because he claims that I am being \"\"confrontational\"\" when it is clearly visible at my talk page that other users are attacking me and not the other way around.  I have not caused any confrontation...   I have replied to other users who are putting a confrontation to me.  (I did ask how to report a user, but I did not actually report him because nobody answered regardless of several posts made, and the user himself did not comment there, so that was not a confrontation like it would have been if I'd been able to make the report.)  I would like to leave a message at this user User:Stwalkerster's talk page but I cannot, because for some reason those are blocked to, so I have to do it this way instead.  Hopefully he has the notifications turned on (tags of username).  I can be calm and work with other people.  This is noted in my first reply, where it gives several examples of how users should have had discussion instead of attacking and reverting me and arguing hostilely on my talk page.  Users who wish to work with me should not make attacks, write words like \"\"compliance\"\", revert edits when they could have further fixed the edit instead (details of referred-to edits in a separate paragraph below, make false claims against me, or delete my replies on discussion pages (not talk pages) and then ARCHIVE it after removing them!!  (Users should not do these kinds of things to anyone.)  What this means is that if users act in a reasonable manner, then a normal discussion can ensue (including from myself).  Merely because someone has used a template, written a shorter reply, or wrote their aggressive, confrontational remarks in a business-style manner, does not mean that they are \"\"being reasonable\"\" or \"\"writing nicely\"\".  When someone makes a falsified report about you or writes a falsified comment, etc., it is not reasonable to expect the victim to reply without mentioning this, or to want to \"\"be friends\"\" with the attacker.  If the other people are being reasonable then of COURSE I am going to reply to them in a different way.  Editing an article by...(below) is not reasonable, nor is \"\"ganging up\"\" (the discussion page), nor is replying in several places at once, etc.  How can replying to other users stating bad and/or false things about you be \"\"confrontational\"\"?  I have mentioned several times about having an actual discussion but no one did this and instead just kept replying on my talk pages.  The fact that I mentioned having a discussion indicates that I think reasonable discussion is the right or reasonable way to do it.

For headline #8, it is truthful and the falsification was blatant by Ebyabe, and I actually expected her to edit it to something on her next message.  I mean she directly mentions it; edit summary says a reason but her message says differently (directly, not implied).  For this headline, it is not a \"\"personal attack\"\" because it is true and evident: Administrator complains about my signature even though signature has been changed, and messages by me since posted, before the block happened, as well as direct linking to comments which contain no personal attacks as a reason for \"\"personal attacks\"\".  If the titles were UNTRUE they would be attacks, but since they are true unambiguously then they can't be attacks. The last headline yes, somewhat motivated/hostile, because he is the one put an useless headline so that there's TWO AT ONCE, *AFTER* my notice is up, while also writing the things that show the actual tyranny (a word used in this case solely because it is already being talked about, and not meant as any attack/instigation/hostile/etc.).

I got a change to see her ass up close and personal one evening, she was naked as a J Bird and sitting in the front of the car drunk as a skunk. The she stated to get in the back set where I was. She put one leg over then another now she was in the back bent over in the front with her bare ass facing right at me. I couldn't resist, I griped both ass cheeks with both my hand and spread them apart, and then pushed my face right in her crack and sniffed up in there. And when she didn't resist and seemed to like it I decided to start licking her, right from her pubic hairs though her pussy over the crotch in and out of the asshole then strait up her crack while squeezing her ass cheeks all the time. God remember MaryAnn on Gilligan’s Island, that’s what her ass and body looked like. She then finely goes in the back sit and sat on my lap and I was fondling her Virginia.\"\n",

Note that I have a very low tolerance for trolls and vandal, so as such I have been the target of such imbeciles from the start of my wiki-career. BR is well aware and can vouch for me that I have a secret-admirer/stalker/impostor out there who would actually stalk and harass those editor(s) who harass me while imposting as me, what I'm doing is nothing less than trying to deflect that from the Indian boy should he carry on with harassing me and then getting that secret-admirer/stalker/impostor to latch on his tail instead. Yes, I may have been a wee bit mad at that moment when I commented to him but I'm not stupid. Him, on the other hand, is just plain stupid for going down that path until eventually that secret-admirer/stalker/impostor reacts to him. What are we to do then? Lastly, the Indian boy had actually picked a very convenient date (end of our one month mutual interaction ban) to revert my edit so I'm fully entitled to be mad at him for being an moronic/insensitive jerk, especially at the condescending tone in his edit summary during that particular revert. Tell me now, does it take two hands or one to clap? In honour of that interaction ban, I've stayed away from him for one whole month (to the letter and the spirit of the law that requires of me but he did so only to the letter) and yet at the end of it, he has the galls to come pick on my edit? Come on, how oxymoron can that be that he is indeed trolling by all account? And both times, he goes to ANI, he doesn't have the courtesy to post an ANI-notice on my page, tell me now if that is not trolling? Forgetting twice?
